# Blueprints & Reference Implementations

**Blueprints** are high-level architectural patterns and reference implementations that guide teams in building scalable and reliable systems on the VeeCode Platform.

## What is a Blueprint?

While a [Golden Path](./golden-paths) focuses on the *workflow* and *automation* to get a specific service to production, a **Blueprint** focuses on the *architecture* and *design* of a solution. It answers questions like:

- "How do we build a microservices architecture?"
- "What is the standard pattern for event-driven systems?"
- "How should we structure our multi-tenant SaaS application?"

## Reference Implementations

We provide reference implementations to demonstrate how to combine various platform capabilities into a cohesive whole.

### Microservices Reference Architecture
*Coming Soon* - A complete example of a microservices-based e-commerce application running on the platform, demonstrating:
- Service-to-service communication (Service Mesh)
- Centralized observability
- Distributed tracing
- GitOps-based deployment

### Data Processing Pipeline
*Coming Soon* - A blueprint for building data ingestion and processing pipelines using Kafka and Spark on Kubernetes.

## Using Blueprints

Blueprints are often codified as **Software Templates** in the DevPortal, allowing you to instantiate a complete architectural pattern with a few clicks. This ensures that new projects start with a solid architectural foundation.

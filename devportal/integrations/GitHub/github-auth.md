## GitHub Authentication Provider

The GitHub Authentication Provider enables users to sign in to VeeCode DevPortal using their GitHub accounts. This integration provides a secure and familiar authentication experience leveraging OAuth 2.0.

    alt="GitHub Login"
    style={{ display: 'block', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />

  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Authentication Options

VeeCode DevPortal supports two methods for GitHub authentication: **GitHub App** and **GitHub OAuth App**.

- Both are OAuth 2.0 based authentication and SSO
- Both have better rate limits against GitHub APIs (GitHub App even better)
- Both allow organization and team-based access control (see integrations)

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account with admin access to your organization
2. Choose what authentication method you want to use:
   - OAuth App (simpler)
   - GitHub App (better rate limits and organization access)

## Option A: OAuth App Authentication (recommended)

A **GitHub OAuth App** provides a simpler setup:

- Users complete a classic OAuth flow
- They receive user tokens with the requested scopes (e.g., `read:user`, `user:email`)
- Scopes are good enough for authentication
- Rate limits are also good

    style={{ display: 'block', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />

  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 1: Create an OAuth App

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application name**: VeeCode DevPortal
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-veecode-instance.com` (local setup is usually "http://localhost:7777")
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://your-veecode-instance.com/api/auth/github/handler/frame`
4. Click "Register application"
5. Note down the **Client ID** and generate a new **Client Secret**

:::note
This can be done at organization level (recommended) or at user level (not recommended). Just use the "Developer Settings" link at organization settings instead.
:::

### Step 2. Configure OAuth App Authentication

Add the following configuration to your `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Option B: GitHub App Authentication

A **GitHub App** provides enhanced security, better rate limits, and more granular permissions. When users sign in via a GitHub App:

- Users complete an OAuth flow through the GitHub App
- They receive short-lived user access tokens scoped by the App's permissions
- The App can be installed organization-wide with fine-grained repository access
- Rate limits are significantly higher

:::important
In production scenarios you will most likely use GitHub Apps for integrations and an OAuth App for authentication. Integrations not only need better rate limits but also organization access that you usually don't want in a consent screen at all.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub App

To use GitHub App authentication:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "New Github App"
3. Fill in the application details:
   - **GitHub App name**: VeeCode DevPortal Auth
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-veecode-instance.com`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://your-veecode-instance.com/api/auth/github/handler/frame`
   - **Permissions**:
     - Account Permissions
       - Email addresses: Read-only
   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed**: only your account or any organization
4. Click "Register application"
5. Create a GitHub App in your organization
6. Install the app to your organization

### Step 2. Configure GitHub App Authentication

Add the following configuration to your `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## A Word on VeeCode Profiles

We created VeeCode Profiles as a simple way to configure authentication and integrations for your VeeCode DevPortal instance. A profile relies on bundled configuration snippets that are activated by environment variables.

You will find more information about VeeCode Profiles in:

- TODO

## Troubleshooting

- **Callback URL Mismatch**: Ensure the callback URL in your GitHub OAuth app matches exactly with your VeeCode DevPortal URL.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Verify that the OAuth app has the required scopes (`read:user`, `user:email`).
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider using GitHub App authentication for higher rate limits.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit client secrets or private keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your client secrets and private keys
- Enable 2FA for your GitHub organization

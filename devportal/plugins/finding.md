Currently there are a few online Backstage plugin catalogs today.

- ðŸ”¥[VeeCode Backstage Plugins](https://plugins.vee.codes/)ðŸ”¥: **this is our curated list of (mostly) VeeCode-mantained and some third-party Backstage plugins. It is intended to evolve into a marketplace-like experience, where we list both bundled and downloadable plugins and how to enable them in your DevPortal instance.**

- [Backstage Plugin Registry](https://backstage.io/plugins): this is the official Backstage plugin registry, but it is not exactly a marketplace-like experience. Some plugins are just links to GitHub repositories, others are not even published as a package. Almost all of them assume you will statically link them to your Backstage custom build as a developer.

- [Roadie Backstage Plugins](https://roadie.io/backstage/plugins/): this is a curated list of (mostly) Roadie-mantained Backstage plugins. It is almost a marketplace-like experience, but the "no-code" approach is proprietary for their closed-source product. When using their plugins you will need to statically link them to your Backstage custom build as a developer (this is referred as "Self-hosted Backstage" in Roadie docs).

:::important
Please understand that Backstage plugin ecossystem is still in its early stages and there are no clear standards for publishing plugins, specially dynamic plugins. We at VeeCode are committed to provide a "no-code" marketplace-like experience for our customers and we are working hard to make it happen.

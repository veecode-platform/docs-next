# CI/CD Plugins

The problem CI/CD plugins solve is the same across every platform: the service is registered in the portal, but its pipeline lives in GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps. Developers context-switch to check builds, find failures, and trigger runs. Each CI/CD plugin closes that gap for one platform by surfacing build status and triggers on the entity page itself — the service and its pipeline become one view.

This is the [Application Lifecycle](/platform/capabilities) capability layer in practice. Pick the plugin that matches the platform your team uses; the activation pattern is the same for all of them.

DevPortal ships several separate CI/CD plugins, each integrating with a specific CI/CD platform. There is no single "CI/CD Plugin" — each platform has its own bundled plugin that must be enabled individually.

All CI/CD plugins described here are **preloaded in the DevPortal image and disabled by default**. Enable them via `dynamic-plugins.yaml` or the Marketplace — no support contact required.

## How CI/CD results appear

The bundled GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps plugins mount their content in the **CI** entity tab (`entity.page.ci/cards`). The tab appears automatically on entities that have the relevant annotation and `disabled: false` in the plugin configuration.

GitHub Workflows mounts as an **overview card** (`entity.page.overview/cards`) rather than in the CI tab, and is controlled by the `github.com/workflows` or `vee.codes/has-github-workflows` annotation.

## Quick enable: GitHub Actions

The simplest CI/CD plugin to enable for GitHub-hosted projects:

```yaml
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-github-actions-dynamic
    disabled: false
    pluginConfig:
      dynamicPlugins:
        frontend:
          backstage-community.plugin-github-actions:
            mountPoints:
              - mountPoint: entity.page.ci/cards
                importName: EntityGithubActionsContent
                config:
                  layout:
                    gridColumn: "1 / -1"
                  if:
                    allOf:
                      - isGithubActionsAvailable
```

Add `github.com/project-slug: my-org/my-repo` to the component's `catalog-info.yaml` and the CI tab will appear.

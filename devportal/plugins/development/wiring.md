Frontend plugins must be wired to the DevPortal instance configuration during dynamic loading, or they will not work at all (despite being loaded). This is a critical feature because - unlike static ones - dynamic plugins cannot imply in code changes to the host Backstage project.

## Understand Frontend Plugin Wiring

All frontend plugins **must** bring their own settings in the `pluginConfig:` field, thus defining routes, sidebars, mount points, icons, APIs, etc.

The sample frontend plugin we have just built and [packaged](packaging.md) defined a page and a sidebar link, so it can be wired to DevPortal with the following configuration:

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
```

## Testing with VKDR

Our [local DevPortal setup](../../installation-guide/local-setup) using `vkdr` can be used to validate locally the wiring of a dynamic frontend plugin.

### Steps

What you need:

- A local npm registry (run [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) at local port 4873)
- Publish the frontend plugin to Verdaccio (as described [here](/devportal/plugins/development/packaging#publish-a-dynamic-plugin))
- Obtain the SHA integrity signature of the published plugin
- A local `vkdr` cluster with DevPortal properly installed - check the [local DevPortal setup](../../installation-guide/local-setup) guide for more info.

### Verdaccio

To start a local Verdaccio registry you may run:

```bash
verdaccio -l 0.0.0.0:4873
```

Do not forget to [package and publish the frontend plugin to Verdaccio](/devportal/plugins/development/packaging#publish-a-dynamic-plugin).

### Signature

To obtain the integrity signature of the published plugin you may run (replace `@your-org/plugin-my-front-plugin-dynamic@x.y.x` with your plugin name):

```bash
npm view @your-org/plugin-my-front-plugin-dynamic@x.y.z --registry http://localhost:4873 dist.integrity
```

:::important
The integrity signature is a SHA512 hash of the plugin package. It is required for the dynamimc plugin to be loaded.

### VKDR Infra Up

To start a local `vkdr` cluster you may run:

```bash
vkdr infra up
```

### VKDR DevPortal Setup

You can provide `vkdr devportal` command a complimentary YAML file containing the configuration for the dynamic plugin you have just published to Verdaccio. Create a file named `merge-dynamic.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: '@your-org/plugin-my-front-plugin-dynamic@x.y.z'
        disabled: false
        integrity: sha512-xxxxxxxxx
        pluginConfig:
          dynamicPlugins:
            frontend:
              your-org.plugin-my-front-plugin:
                dynamicRoutes:
                  - path: /my-front-plugin
                    importName: MyFrontPluginPage
                    menuItem:
                      icon: LibraryBooks
                      text: My Plugin Page
                      enabled: true
```

Notice this config is equivalent to the static wiring we did in the [frontend plugin](frontend-plugin.md#wire-the-plugin-into-backstage) guide, enabling a route and a sidebar link.

To start `vkdr` and install DevPortal you may run (you need a valid Github token):

```bash
vkdr infra up
vkdr devportal install --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --samples --npm "http://host.k3d.internal:4873" \
  --merge ./merge-dynamic.yaml
```

:::note
This command installs DebPortal with the extra plugin wiring. It also installs a few sample apps and configures DevPortal to rely on Verdaccio as an external npm registry.

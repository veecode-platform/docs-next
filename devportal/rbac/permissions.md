title: RBAC Permissions
---

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of managing access to system resources based on user roles. Instead of assigning permissions directly to individual users, roles are created with predefined permissions, and users are assigned to these roles. This approach simplifies permission management and enhances security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Each permission in the RBAC system is structured as follows:

- **Name**: Identifier of the permission.
- **Policy**: The action allowed by the permission (e.g., `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- **Description**: Explanation of what the permission allows.
- **Requirements**: Dependencies required for the permission to be granted.

| Name | Policy | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| policy.entity.read | read | Allows the user to read permission policies/roles | X |
| policy.entity.create | create | Allows the user to create permission policies/roles | X |

:::note
`policy.entity.update` and `policy.entity.delete` are not granted in the default shipped policy. Add them to a custom role if needed.

Welcome to VeeCode Developer Portal documentation! This document will guide you through our Developer Portal, which is a modern and open-source Platform Engineering solution designed to help organizations better manage their API and service ecosystems.

### What is VeeCode DevPortal?

VeeCode DevPortal is an open-source platform built on top of [Backstage](https://backstage.io), an open-source developer portal framework created by Spotify. Backstage has a growing community and is being used by many organizations, including large technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Verizon.

VeeCode DevPortal is a Backstage distro that provides a production-grade portal on day one: catalog, software templates, tech docs, search, and SSO already wired.

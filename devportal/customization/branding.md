There is an entire branding section in the `appConfig` section of DevPortal configuration that lets you pick one of the pre-defined theme variants and its light/dark options, allowing you top customize every single aspect from it.

## The default config

The default branding values are defined in `app-config.yaml` (base layer). Override them in `app-config.local.yaml` (mounted at `/app/app-config.local.yaml`):

```yaml
app:
  branding:
    fullLogo: https://veecode-platform.github.io/support/logos/logo.svg
    iconLogo: https://veecode-platform.github.io/support/logos/logo-mobile.png
    fullLogoWidth: 150
    theme:
      light:
        variant: "backstage"
        palette:
          navigation:
            background: "#222222"
      dark:
        variant: "backstage"
        palette:
          navigation:
            background: "#222222"
```

:::note About `fullLogoDark`
`fullLogoDark` is read by `CompanyLogo.tsx` and applied as the logo when the dark theme is active. Set it to a separate URL if you want distinct light and dark logos. The "new form breaks sidebar, check later" note in the source applies to a commented-out object form of `fullLogo` (a light/dark map), not to `fullLogoDark`.

A few points to remember:

- You can provide URLs to your custom resources, but remember those must be available to end users' browsers.
- You must add the base URL of those resources to the `csp.img-src` list.

## External domains and CSP

DevPortal ships with a Content-Security-Policy that restricts which domains can serve images (and other resource types) to the browser. If your logo, icon, or favicon URL is on a domain not already allowed, the browser blocks it — the image silently falls back to default, and the console shows a CSP violation.

Extend `backend.csp.img-src` in your `app-config.local.yaml` to add your domain:

```yaml
backend:
  csp:
    img-src:
      - "'self'"
      - "data:"
      - "https://your-cdn.example.com"
      # ...plus every domain your instance's current effective config already allows
```

:::warning Config overrides replace arrays, they don't merge them
Backstage's config loader replaces array-valued config on override rather than appending to it. If you set `backend.csp.img-src` without including everything already in the default list, you don't just fail to add your domain — you break every other domain that was previously allowed (analytics, GitHub avatars, etc.). Read your instance's current effective `img-src` list before overriding it, and repeat it in full alongside your addition. The same rule applies to `connect-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, and any other CSP directive.
:::

**Troubleshooting:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Logo/icon doesn't render, falls back to default | Domain missing from `backend.csp.img-src` | Extend `img-src` with your domain, keeping all existing entries |
| Extending `img-src` broke unrelated images (avatars, analytics) | The override replaced the array instead of extending it | Re-add the full previous list plus your addition |

## A Simple config

A simple and funny config just to show some settings change:

```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        variant: "backstage"
        typography:
          fontFamily: "Verdana"
          htmlFontSize: 20 # smaller is bigger
          h1:
            fontFamily: "Comic Sans MS"
        palette:
          text:
            primary: "#000066"
            secondary: "#0099ff"
      dark:
        variant: "backstage"
        typography:
          fontFamily: "Verdana"
          htmlFontSize: 20 # smaller is bigger
          h1:
            fontFamily: "Comic Sans MS"
        palette:
          text:
            primary: "#ffcc00"
            secondary: "#0099ff"
```

## Other examples

A complete config for the "backstage" variant theme settings is below (obtained from [RHDH: Default Backstage theme color palette](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html/customizing_red_hat_developer_hub/customizing-appearance#default-backstage-theme-color-palette)):

:::note
Most of RHDH theme settings are also available in the DevPortal, feel free to try them. We have made our "home" and "header" plugins compatible with RHDH, so chances are you will be ok. The RHDH theme variant "rhdh" is also available in the DevPortal, but we like "backstage" better.

Please understand the file above is just a dump of the "backstage" variant's default values. You can simply refer to it and the default values will apply:

```yaml
app:
  branding:
    theme:
      light:
        variant: "backstage"
        mode: "light"
      dark:
        variant: "backstage"
        mode: "dark"
```

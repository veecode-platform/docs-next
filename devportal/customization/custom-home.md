The entire DevPortal “home” can be replaced by your own custom dynamic plugin.

:::info
Please understand this is a development effort that involves coding a custom plugin and packaging it as an NPM package.
:::

The process for creating a “plugin-home” is described in the official Backstage documentation at [Backstage homepage - Setup and Customization](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/homepage).

## Source code

The source code for the current DevPortal home plugin is at [VeeCode Header Plugin](https://github.com/veecode-platform/devportal-plugins/tree/main/workspace/homepage)

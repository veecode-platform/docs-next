# Configuration Profiles (`VEECODE_PROFILE`)

DevPortal ships seven **configuration profiles**, each enabling a different authentication and identity provider. A profile is selected at startup by setting the `VEECODE_PROFILE` environment variable. The entrypoint script loads the corresponding `app-config.<profile>.yaml` on top of the base configuration.

---

## The 7 Profiles

| Profile | Provider | Primary use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github-pat` | GitHub (Personal Access Token) | GitHub integration without OAuth sign-in; uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for catalog/org-sync only |
| `github` | GitHub OAuth App | Full GitHub integration with OAuth sign-in |
| `gitlab` | GitLab OAuth App | Full GitLab integration with OAuth sign-in |
| `keycloak` | Keycloak | Enterprise SSO via OpenID Connect |
| `azure` | Azure AD | Microsoft Entra ID / Azure Active Directory |
| `ldap` | Generic LDAP | LDAP directory integration |
| `ldap-ad` | Active Directory (LDAP) | AD-specific LDAP with `sAMAccountName` and AD object classes |

---

## What a profile configures

A profile is not a mode or a switch — it is a YAML config file (`app-config.<profile>.yaml`) that gets merged into the configuration stack at startup. Each profile configures three things at once:

1. **Authentication provider** — which sign-in page to show and which OAuth flow to use
2. **Catalog discovery** — where to look for `catalog-info.yaml` files (GitHub org, GitLab group, etc.)
3. **SCM integration** — credentials for the source control system so the catalog processor and scaffolder can read repositories

This means that setting `VEECODE_PROFILE=github` and seeing "GitHub login works, catalog populated, templates executing in GitHub" is not magic — it is those three things being configured by a single file. To see exactly what was set, read the profile file directly inside the container:

```bash
docker exec devportal cat /app/app-config.github.yaml
```

Replace `github` with whatever profile you set. The file is the complete source of truth for what the profile configured.

If something works that you didn't explicitly configure, it came from the profile. If you need to override any of it, add the relevant key to your `app-config.local.yaml` — it loads after the profile and wins.

## How Profiles Are Loaded

At container startup, `entrypoint.sh` reads `VEECODE_PROFILE` and passes the matching config file as an extra `--config` argument to Backstage:

```
app-config.yaml
  → app-config.production.yaml
    → app-config.<profile>.yaml    ← loaded here
      → app-config.distro.yaml
        → app-config.local.yaml    ← your overrides go here
          → ...
```

See [Configuration Hierarchy](./configuration-hierarchy.md) for the full 7-layer merge order.

## Key Environment Variables per Profile

### `github-pat`
| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | Personal Access Token for catalog/org-sync |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | Yes | GitHub organization name |

This profile does **not** enable OAuth sign-in. Users authenticate as guest or via another mechanism.

### `github`
| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | GitHub App client ID (for integrations) |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | GitHub App client secret (for integrations) |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | Yes | GitHub App ID |
| `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | GitHub App private key (YAML block scalar `\|`) |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | Yes | GitHub organization name |

Sign-in uses `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. If those are unset, the entrypoint auto-copies `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` → `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` → `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, so a single GitHub App's OAuth credentials can serve both sign-in and integration.

### `gitlab`
| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITLAB_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | GitLab OAuth Application client ID |
| `GITLAB_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | GitLab OAuth Application client secret |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | Yes | Personal/group token for catalog integration |
| `GITLAB_HOST` | Yes | GitLab host (e.g., `gitlab.com`) |
| `GITLAB_GROUP` | Yes | Root group for catalog discovery |

### `keycloak`
| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL` | Yes | e.g., `https://keycloak.example.com` |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Client ID in Keycloak |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Client secret |
| `KEYCLOAK_REALM` | Yes | Realm name |
| `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Session encryption secret |

The entrypoint derives `KEYCLOAK_METADATA_URL` from `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL` + `KEYCLOAK_REALM` if not set explicitly.

### `azure`
| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Azure AD app client ID |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Azure AD app client secret |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Yes | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `AZURE_ORGANIZATION` | Yes | Azure DevOps organization |
| `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Session encryption secret |

### `ldap` / `ldap-ad`
See `app-config.ldap.yaml` / `app-config.ldap-ad.yaml` for the full set of `LDAP_*` variables. The `ldap-ad` profile defaults `LDAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true` and uses AD-specific object classes.

---

## Notes

- RSA private keys (e.g., `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`) **must** use a YAML block scalar (`|`) to preserve newlines. Inline strings break parsing.
- If no profile is set, the base `app-config.yaml` guest auth is used (development only).
- Profiles are additive — the profile config merges on top of the base; it does not replace it.

For installation instructions that use these profiles, see the [installation guide](/devportal/installation-guide/simple-setup).
